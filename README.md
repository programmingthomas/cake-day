#Cake Day

Cake Day is a simple iPhone app that reminds you when your Cake Day is on reddit. I have chosen to open source the app so that people can see how it is relatively easy to transition a pure Objective-C app to a pure Swift app.

To get started with the source you'll need to clone the repository and run `pod install` to fetch the CocoaPods that the project uses.

The app is available under the MIT license.
